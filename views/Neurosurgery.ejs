                    <h2>Brain Operation:</h2>
                    <p>Brain surgery is a critical and complicated process. The type of brain surgery done depends highly on the condition being treated. Brain surgery is used to treat a variety of conditions, such as tumors, blood clots, aneurysms, epilepsy, and Parkinson’s disease. Advances in medical technology have enabled surgeons to operate on portions of the brain without a single incision in or near the head.</p>

                    <h2>Spine Surgery:</h2>
                    <p>Back surgery is a procedure that aims to change a patient’s anatomy, such as removing a herniated disc that is causing pain, with the purpose of providing pain relief. Back surgeries vary, with some procedures minimally invasive and allowing for quick recovery and others more extensive and requiring longer recoveries.</p>

                    <h2>Slipped Disk Operation:</h2>
                    <p>This kind of pain arises due to injury or weakness in the inner portion of the disc. In this, the disc protrudes through the outer ring. This is also referred to as prolapsed disc, herniated disc, or slipped disc. Your doctor might suggest physical therapy to help with your pain. Physical therapists can show you positions and exercises designed to minimize the pain of a slipped disk.</p>
